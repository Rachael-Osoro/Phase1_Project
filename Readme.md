## **Business Problem**

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## **Research Questions**

1.   Which movie genres return higher profit margins in the box office?
2.   Which months should movies be released?
3.   Find out the estimated production_cost?

## **Data**

Data sets used in this analysis include: ```imdb.title.basics.csv.gz```, ```rt.movie_info.csv.gz```, ```tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz```, ```imdb.title.ratings.csv.gz``` and ```bom.movie_gross.csv.gz```
Each data set has different variables. Describing movie names, genres, ratings, production budget, time of year the movie was released.

## **Methods**

The project involved descriptive data analysis of parameters.
Datasets for this analysis were provided in .csv and/ or .tsv format. 
Data was cleaned, descriptive analysis and visualization done using python.

# **Results**

Movie production budget and return of investment of the movies have a positive correlation of 0.6843 which might imply that the higher the movie budget, the more expected return of investment on movies.

A budget of between 200 and approximately 400 million seems to yield better returns.

Promote movies in foreign countries as movie grossing has remained higher than domestic gross income.

From the bar graph below, It is implied that the best months to release a movie include May, June, July, November and December This may be due to November and December being holiday months and May, June and July being summer months, hence many people are free to watch new releases.

Recommendations

Following this descriptive data analysis, here are three recommendations:

1. **Invest in popular genres.** Genres such as Documentaries, Drama, Action, Comedy thriller Horror as they are more popular hence higher profits compared to less popular ones such as Western, Reality-TV, Talk-Show, Adult, Short, Game-Show.

2. **Higher Production cost.** Investing between 200 million and approximately 400 million dollars shows probability of returning higher profits. for instance, the movie Avatar had a budget of 425 million dollars: its return on investiment was over 5 billion dollars.

3. **Release time.** Movies released over summer (May, June, July) and November and December had higher returns compared to the rest of the year. Hiring directors with consistently high return of investment on their movies. This may also contribute to movie production at Microsoft being a successful venture.
